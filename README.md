# diversified-vs-tech-ETFs-portfolios-analysis

(in progress)

What this project **is**:
This project is an attempt to enhance understanding of risk management and learn to visualize key performance metrics of modern portfolio theory, as well as analyze return vs risk dynamics in diversification strategy of ETFs investments. To achieve this, a comparison between portfolio consisting of tech companies only ETF (XLK) and an equal-weight, diversified by different industry sectors, ETFs portfolio is conducted. Main hypothesis of this analysis is: While a concentrated allocation to the technology sector (XLK) generated superior returns, an equal-weight diversified portfolio of major sector ETFs achieved a better risk-adjusted return with significantly lower maximum drawdown, providing sufficient resiliance to the market stress of first half of 2020 and bear market of 2022.
Area of analysis:
- Market: US
- Weights rebalancing: quarterly 
- Period: from beginning of 2014 to the end of 2024.

What this project **isn't**:
This project is not an attempt to figure out best possible portfolio for abovementioned period of time or any future period, nor exploring weight assigning methods, however it lays foundations for such work in the future.


This project did not have a concrete step by step plan at the beginning, so I invite you, dear Reader, to follow the same journey as I did.
